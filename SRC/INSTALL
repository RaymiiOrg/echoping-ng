echoping appears to compile and run at least on Tru64 (ex-Digital
Unix, ex-OSF/1), Solaris, Linux, SunOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, IRIX and
Ultrix. You do not have to be root to install it.

Just type "./configure", then "make", and then (as root if necessary),
"make install".

"configure" has some options: 
--disable-http (suppress the HTTP support)
--disable-smtp (suppress the SMTP support)
--enable-icp   (add the ICP support, to monitor Web proxies like Squid)
--enable-ssl   (add the SSL support, you will need the OpenSSL library 
               <http://www.openssl.org/>)
--disable-ttcp  (suppress the T/TCP support which is enabled only if 
         your system supports it - FreeBSD does. See 
         <http://www.kohala.com/start/ttcp.html>)

Standard "autoconf/configure" options are supported such as --prefix
to set the installation root directory.

If 'echoping -h' replies with a "404" error while the file really exists,
check first that you use the FQDN of the server on the command line
(this is a consequence of the HTTP 1.1 protocol, not a bug in echoping
and this will show only if the HTTP server uses "virtual hosting").
