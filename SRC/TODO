Wishes:

Display other calculations such as kurtosis.

Check the TCP timeout with T/TCP. Difficult to test, few T/TCP
machines exist.

TCP timeout with long packets seem to confuse Cisco routers. Does
someone can reproduce it and perform tests? It seems to work now.

Do not display the end-of-line after the HTTP reply, for instance when
a page is moved.

UDP isn't really useable with large packets because of sockets
limitations and the lack of workaround code.

If a Web page is empty, echoping
will display meaningless messages.

Timeouts on T/TCP connections are a bit experimental. 

Since echoping writes everything to the server, then begins to read
the reply, some echo servers will timeout if you send very long
messages, because they expect you to start to read right now.
